# Windows Joycon setup package.

### By D Schaedler

The scripts in this package will install and configure your computer to use two combined (1 set, L and R) Nintendo Joycon controllers as a single controller input.

### Use

The scripts should be self explanatory.

Install.bat installs vJoy, prompts the user to configure vJoy, creates a shortcut to \assets\joycon-driver\joycon-driver.exe, and provides more basic instruction.

Connect.bat starts vJoyConf.exe and JoyMonitor.exe. vJoyConf.exe is required to connect the JoyCons, and JoyMonitor.exe allows the user to check the joycon button layouts.
